# THE-BUNKER-web-browser
IMAGINE a web browser that isn't a resource hog IMAGINE a web browser that doesnt force install opera to your computer and spy on you WELL LOOK NO FURTHER because right here I have a web browser that makes you look cool a web browser that you can show to your friends a web browser for the TRUE gamer

# also btw it isnt out yet but it will be in maybe a year or two considering how much i like to say ill be consistant with a project and then stop working on it a day later

BUT ANYWAYS

# proof of concept image of the home screen because this will not be powered by google and i will probably have the google search engine blocked you know when you start up a fresh install of microsoft's malware and then you go on edge to install chrome but then bing tries to convince you to keep using edge well the bunker will basically do that but instead of politely asking you to not use chrome or google it will simply not allow you to use google

malicous intent besides the bunker is worth it and heres proof heres what the home page will look like
